# Implementation Packages — Index

[Feature index](../../features/feature-index.md)

Implementation Packages (`IP-xxxx`) convert an approved Feature Specification (`FS-xxx`) into a
build-ready unit of work: architecture components, interfaces, files, tasks, tests, and a
Definition-of-Done/Verification checklist. Each package traces to exactly one Feature Specification
(or a lettered slice of one, where a Feature was too large for a single package, e.g. FS-105 →
IP-1050 + IP-1051) and to one or more Functional/Non-Functional Requirements where an explicit
citation exists.

```
Feature Specification (FS-xxx) → Implementation Package (IP-xxxx, here) → Code → Tests
```

**This tree supersedes [`docs/implementations/`](../../implementations/INDEX.md) (`IMP-xxxA`) as the
canonical Implementation Package corpus.** See
[`../00-master-build-plan.md`](../00-master-build-plan.md) §"Relationship to the prior
`docs/implementations/` corpus" for the full rationale; the prior corpus's files remain in place
with a superseded-by banner, not deleted, since they carry the same underlying design content this
tree re-derives under a different template/ID scheme/location.

## Two distinct situations this tier covers

Carried forward unchanged from the prior corpus's own framing (still accurate):

| Situation | What the package does | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| **Capability already implemented, independently verified** | Documents the *actual* existing architecture against its Feature Spec — a retroactive as-built record, verified against real module/class/method names in `spacesim/`. Status `VERIFIED`. | FS-101 through FS-107, FS-109, FS-110, FS-111 |
| **Capability already implemented, not yet independently verified** | Same as above, but authored by `07-implementation-planning` rather than confirmed by a separate `09-package-verification` pass — per that skill's own status vocabulary, enters at `COMPLETE`, not `VERIFIED`. | FS-114, FS-115 (FR-4110 slice, `IP-1150`) |
| **Capability partially implemented (gap-closing)** | Documents what already exists, scopes the remaining gap as a build-ready forward design, and does not claim the Feature is closed. Status `READY` or `BLOCKED`, same authorization rule as a fully forward-design package. | FS-112 |
| **Capability not yet implemented** | Proposes a from-scratch design satisfying the Feature Spec's requirements — genuinely forward-looking, not yet built, and **not authorized for coding merely by being documented** (MSTR-006 §3). Status `READY` or `BLOCKED`. | FS-201, FS-301, FS-113, FS-115 (FR-4210 slice, `IP-1151`) |

FS-108 and FS-202 have no Implementation Package in this pass — both remain unauthorized
"(candidate)" Feature Specs ([feature-index.md](../../features/feature-index.md)); per
[MSTR-006](../../master/MSTR-006-governance-principles.md) §3, no package work may begin against an
unauthorized FS.

FS-108/FS-202 have no Implementation Package (unauthorized candidates, MSTR-006 §3). **IP-1090,
IP-1100, IP-1110 are new (2026-07)**, split out of IP-1060 v1.0 per `docs/feature-planning/
05-feature-review.md` Finding F-03, mirroring the FS-106→FS-106/109/110/111 split — see IP-1060
v2.0's own header note. **IP-1120, IP-1130, IP-1140, IP-1150, IP-1151 are new (2026-07)**, the
first Implementation Packages written against FS-112/113/114/115 — see
[`../01-technical-work-breakdown.md`](../01-technical-work-breakdown.md) Tranche 1 for the
build-status verification pass and split rationale each required. **`IP-1150` is now `VERIFIED`**
(2026-07-03, [`VR-1150`](../verification/VR-1150-vignette-selection.md) — the first package in
this tranche, and the first in this plan, verified through the formal `09-package-verification`
process). **`IP-1140` is also now `VERIFIED`** (2026-07-03, run #9,
[`VR-1140`](../verification/VR-1140-hot-seat-handoff.md)) — its documented FR-6610 trigger/menu
divergence was adjudicated during that pass and found **not** to satisfy FR-6610's full intent; a
High-severity finding is now routed to `07-implementation-planning` for a gap-closing package,
pending the user's explicit prioritization (see `VR-1140` and Master Build Plan Risk item 6).
**`IP-2010` is now `VERIFIED`** (2026-07-04, run #11,
[`VR-2010`](../verification/VR-2010-competency-assessment.md) —
`session/assessment.py` + `custody_confidence_at_decision` in `orders.py`/`custody.py` confirmed
against the live tree; two Medium findings filed against FS-201's own Acceptance Criteria scope,
routed to `06-feature-specification`, not against this package). **`IP-1120` is also now
`COMPLETE`** (implemented 2026-07-03, one resolved `classification` value threaded through
`session/manager.py`/`inprocess.py`/`aar.py`/`ui_web/`), likewise pending
`09-package-verification`. **`IP-1130` is also now `COMPLETE`** (implemented 2026-07-03, a
server-side mutation-rejection guard on every mutating route plus a White-Cell-designated Observer
read path in `session/inprocess.py`/`ui_web/server.py`/`ui_web/static/`), likewise pending
`09-package-verification`. **`IP-1151` is also now `COMPLETE`** (implemented 2026-07-03,
`Vignette.roles_needed`/`RoleRequirement`, `SessionManager.assign_role`/`staffing_report`,
`InProcessSession.start()` hard-gated on unmet mandatory roles, `/roles/assign`+`/roles/staffing`
endpoints, White-Cell-only seat-assignment UI), likewise pending `09-package-verification` — with
one open finding: no role-based command-filtering consumer exists yet in `FS-105`/`IP-1050`/
`IP-1051` (see the package's own Risks section and Master Build Plan Risk item 8). **`IP-3010` is
also now `COMPLETE`** (implemented 2026-07-04, run #10 — a new `spacesim/tools/` subpackage
(`research_batch.run_batch()`, seeded-Monte-Carlo batch runner) and `session/research_export.py`
(`RunRecord` + CSV/JSON export extending `aar.export_csv()`'s pattern), reading
`session/assessment.py`'s `assessment_report` once per run), likewise pending
`09-package-verification`.

**Authorization update (2026-07-03):** the project owner reviewed every package gated on MSTR-006
§3 and authorized `IP-2010`, `IP-1130`, `IP-1120`, and `IP-1151` (recorded in
`docs/pipeline/pipeline-journal.md` run #2) — `IP-3010` was **not** authorized this round.
Authorization is a separate axis from the `READY`/`BLOCKED`/`COMPLETE` status vocabulary above: at
authorization time, `IP-1120`/`IP-1151` were still `BLOCKED` on `IP-1150` reaching `VERIFIED`
regardless of being authorized — that gate cleared the same day (`VR-1150`), so both are now
`READY`. **`IP-3010` was subsequently authorized too (2026-07-03, run #9)**, and implemented
2026-07-04 (run #10) — it is now `COMPLETE`.

**Executing a package.** The `08-code-implementation` skill
(`.claude/skills/08-code-implementation/SKILL.md`) is the next stage downstream of this tier: it
selects exactly one `READY`-and-eligible package, implements it, and advances its status to
`COMPLETE`. It never authors or edits a package (that remains this tier's job) and never advances a
package past `COMPLETE` to `VERIFIED` (that belongs to `09-package-verification`). Per this
repository's MSTR-006 §3 rule, `08-code-implementation` treats `READY` status as necessary but not
sufficient for any forward-design package until a separate, explicit user go-ahead is on record —
`IP-2010`, `IP-1120`, `IP-1130`, `IP-1151`, and `IP-3010` have all received that go-ahead and have
since all been implemented (`COMPLETE`). **No package in this plan remains `READY`** — every
package now has either shipped (`VERIFIED`) or been implemented (`COMPLETE`, pending
`09-package-verification`).

## Status legend

Per the task's fixed status vocabulary (distinct from the general corpus's MSTR-006 §2 symbol set,
used because this tier's deliverable is an executable build plan, not a general document):

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| NOT STARTED | Package is specified but no upstream dependency work has begun. |
| READY | Design complete, all upstream dependencies satisfied — blocked only on authorization/scheduling, not on missing prerequisite work. |
| IN PROGRESS | Implementation actively underway. |
| BLOCKED | Blocked on a specific named dependency (another package, an external decision) reaching a required state first. |
| COMPLETE | Implementation finished, tests passing, not yet independently re-verified. |
| VERIFIED | Implementation finished, tested, and independently confirmed against the current source tree (this pass's as-built packages: file/line citations checked against the live `spacesim/` tree at authoring time). |

**The original 11 as-built packages (`IP-1010`…`IP-1110`) are `VERIFIED`, not `COMPLETE`**, because
the pass that authored them read and confirmed every cited file/line reference against the current
source tree rather than merely asserting the code exists — that pass combined what
`07-implementation-planning` and `09-package-verification` now do as separate stages. **This
tranche's two new as-built packages (`IP-1140`, `IP-1150`) followed the current, stricter separation
instead**: `07-implementation-planning` confirmed the cited code exists, entering both at
`COMPLETE`; both have since passed independent `09-package-verification` (`VR-1150`, `VR-1140`) and
are now `VERIFIED`.

## Authoring note

Each as-built package was written against the real module/class/method names in `spacesim/` (cited
inline), re-verified by reading the relevant source file's signatures during this pass — these are
not idealized descriptions but should be re-checked against the code if it changes materially after
this pass. Each forward-design package is explicitly speculative, states its open design questions
rather than presenting invented detail as settled, and is **not** an authorization to begin coding
(MSTR-006 §3) — see [`00-master-build-plan.md`](../00-master-build-plan.md) for the authorization
gate stated once, program-wide, rather than repeated ad hoc per package.
