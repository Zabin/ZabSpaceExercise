# Verification Reports — Index

[↑ Master Build Plan](../00-master-build-plan.md) · [Packages index](../packages/INDEX.md) · [Docs index](../../INDEX.md)

Verification Reports (`VR-xxxx`, numbered to match their Implementation Package — `IP-1050` →
`VR-1050`) are the sole evidence that a package independently confirmed `COMPLETE → VERIFIED`, per
the `09-package-verification` skill (`.claude/skills/09-package-verification/SKILL.md`). Each
report re-derives every Definition-of-Done and Verification-Checklist item, every `Requirements
Covered` ID, and a full test run against the live source tree — nothing is taken on the package's
own word.

**This index covers only packages verified through this VR-report process.** The original 11
as-built packages (`IP-1010`…`IP-1110`) were marked `VERIFIED` by the pass that authored them
(which combined what `07-implementation-planning`/`09-package-verification` now do as separate
stages) and predate this convention — they carry no `VR-xxxx` report on disk. Closing that
retroactively is a standing gap, not addressed by this index's creation.

## Index

| ID | Package | Date | Result | Headline findings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [VR-1150](VR-1150-vignette-selection.md) | [IP-1150](../packages/IP-1150-vignette-selection.md) — Session Setup: Vignette Selection & Parameter Tuning | 2026-07-03 | ✅ VERIFIED | Full suite 490 passed/3 skipped, both permanent gates green. RTM `FR-4110` `Test`/`Impl. Package` cells were stale (`UNASSIGNED`) — corrected. One Low finding: the package's own "no zero-override test exists" claim was factually wrong (coverage already existed); no functional gap. |
| [VR-1140](VR-1140-hot-seat-handoff.md) | [IP-1140](../packages/IP-1140-hot-seat-handoff.md) — Hot-Seat Hand-Off Screen-Blank Menu | 2026-07-03 | ✅ VERIFIED | Full suite 559 passed/3 skipped, both permanent gates green. RTM `FR-6610` `Test`/`Impl. Package` cells were stale (`UNASSIGNED`) — corrected. **`BL-0003` adjudicated: the shipped manual-button/auto-cycle mechanism does NOT satisfy FR-6610's full intent** — one High finding (the missing automatic-trigger detection is a real, unmitigated fog-of-war-leak risk in the catalog's one client-side-only-enforced Feature), routed to `07-implementation-planning` for a gap-closing package; **the project owner subsequently accepted this risk (2026-07-04) rather than authorizing remediation.** One Low finding: stale line-number citations (content confirmed correct at new locations). |
| [VR-2010](VR-2010-competency-assessment.md) | [IP-2010](../packages/IP-2010-competency-assessment.md) — Competency Assessment: Rubric Computation | 2026-07-04 | ✅ VERIFIED | Full suite 566 passed/3 skipped, both permanent gates green. RTM `FR-10110` cell updated to reflect `VERIFIED`. `BL-0007` adjudicated (the `index.html` panel-markup inclusion was appropriate scope, not creep). `BL-0018` resolved (no impact on `IP-3010`'s already-shipped schema). Two Medium findings: FS-201's own Acceptance Criteria are broader than what `IP-2010` built — a longitudinal per-trainee report (explicitly, knowingly deferred by the package itself) and self-assessment/debrief-mode accessibility (not implemented, and not flagged as excluded anywhere in the package). One Low finding: a documented, well-justified signature deviation in `confidence_at_decision` (avoids an import cycle). |
| [VR-3010](VR-3010-research-analytics.md) | [IP-3010](../packages/IP-3010-research-analytics.md) — Research Analytics: Multi-Run Export | 2026-07-04 | ✅ VERIFIED | Full suite 566 passed/3 skipped, both permanent gates green (unchanged since run #10). RTM `FR-10210` cell updated to reflect `VERIFIED`. `BL-0018` re-confirmed resolved against the current tree (not merely cited from `VR-2010`). `BL-0017` confirmed accurate (`spacesim/tools/` is genuinely new and correctly importable; the repo-root `tools/` is not a package). No new findings. **Independence caveat stated explicitly**: implemented run #10, verified run #12, same session, no compaction boundary — the user's "iterate through all" request is read as accepting this, recorded rather than assumed. |
| [VR-1120](VR-1120-classification-banner.md) | [IP-1120](../packages/IP-1120-classification-banner.md) — Classification Banner | 2026-07-04 | ✅ VERIFIED | Full suite 566 passed/3 skipped, both permanent gates green. RTM `FR-4510`/`NFR-3100` `Impl. Package` cells updated to reflect `VERIFIED` (`FR-4510`'s pre-existing Title-column defect re-confirmed present, already tracked as `BL-0010`, correctly left untouched). Both documented Implementation Tasks deviations (transport choice for `list_sessions()`; `from_state` restoring `classification`) confirmed accurate, harmless, and in-scope. One Low finding: the package's own DoD text names a non-existent `aar.export_json` function (the actual JSON path is a FastAPI route dumping the same model) — informational only. |
| [VR-1130](VR-1130-observer-read-only-access.md) | [IP-1130](../packages/IP-1130-observer-read-only-access.md) — Observer Read-Only Access | 2026-07-04 | ✅ VERIFIED | Full suite 566 passed/3 skipped, both permanent gates green. RTM `FR-6510` `Impl. Package` cell updated (Title-column defect re-confirmed present, already tracked as `BL-0012`). **`BL-0011`'s predicted route-guard maintenance-drift risk investigated directly and found not yet materialized**: both mutating routes added since this package shipped (`IP-1151`'s `/roles/assign`; this package's own `/observer/view` POST) reject Observer correctly via a stricter White-Cell-only allowlist check, not `_reject_observer`. One Low finding: neither route has an explicit `cell="observer"` test (functional risk effectively nil, coverage gap only). |
