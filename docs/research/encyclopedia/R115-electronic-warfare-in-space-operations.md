## 1. Purpose

Electronic warfare is the simulator's most "physics-forward" effect category — jam success and
footprint are derived from power/modulation/bandwidth inputs rather than an operator-typed
probability — and this topic gives the implementer the `jam.py` model behind it so a new EW feature
computes consistently with the existing one.

## 2. Scope

Covers: the `MODULATIONS` effectiveness/detectability/attribution tradeoff, the derive-from-physical-
inputs success-probability rule, and the window-gated-vs-cyber doctrinal contrast. Does **not**
cover: the link/interference state EW denies ([R110](R110-communications.md)), or the five-D taxonomy EW operates within
at the doctrine level (MSTR-002).

## 3. Concepts

**Modulation choice trades effectiveness against detectability and attribution.** The
`MODULATIONS` database (`barrage`/`spot`/`sweep`/`deceptive`) each carry `effectiveness`,
`radius_factor`, `attribution_bias`, `detectability`, and `power_factor` — `deceptive` is the most
effective (1.30×) and least detectable (0.20) but is `overt`-attributed once discovered (it
requires intercepting the victim's own signal first), while `barrage` is blunt, easily detected
(0.90), but only `ambiguous`-attributed. This mirrors the real noise-jamming taxonomy: spot jamming
concentrates full power on one frequency (high power-per-Hz, easily defeated by a frequency-agile
victim), sweep jamming shifts that same full-power spot across frequencies in quick succession, and
barrage jamming spreads power across the whole band simultaneously at the cost of per-frequency
power density, while deceptive jamming intercepts and replays a modified version of the victim's own
signal rather than overpowering it
([DTIC, *Effects of Jamming on Radars*, ADA380927](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA380927.pdf)
([Wayback](https://web.archive.org/web/2026/https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA380927.pdf))).
There is no free "best" choice — every modulation is a distinct point on an
effectiveness/detectability/attribution tradeoff surface.

**Success probability is fully derived from physical inputs, not operator-typed.** Per the Jun 2026
Commands audit (§C2), `OrderSystem._exec_payload`'s jam branch computes a `base_prob` from a
power-scaled curve (`0.6 + 0.3·√(power_w/100)`, capped at 0.98) then applies `jam.effective_success_prob`
to adjust for modulation and the bandwidth-coverage ratio (`bandwidth_hz` vs. `victim_bandwidth_hz`)
— the operator chooses power/modulation/bandwidth, not a success number directly. A legacy
operator-supplied `success_prob` is parsed for save-file back-compat only and otherwise ignored.

**Jamming is gated by the `jam_footprint` access channel, exactly like other ground-based effects.**
`AccessProvider._weapon_predicate`-style gating via `_ground_sat_predicate` with `jam_mask_deg`
means a jammer must have geometric access (elevation above mask) to the victim, just like a command
uplink — EW is window-gated, the explicit doctrinal contrast with cyber ([R116](R116-cyber-operations-against-space-systems.md)).

**Defensive postures reduce the *experienced* effect, not the underlying probability database.**
`def.frequency_hop` and `satcom.mitigate_interference`/`shift_users` act on the defender's side
(`freq_hopping`, `interference_mitigation`) and are applied by the effect resolver as modifiers —
the attacker's computed `adj_prob` represents the attack's raw potency; the resolver, not the jam
math, is where defender posture knocks it down.

## 4. Operational Context

Real electronic warfare against satellite links is exactly this kind of engineering tradeoff:
power, modulation sophistication, and bandwidth coverage against a link's actual occupied spectrum
determine denial effectiveness, while modulation choice independently determines how detectable and
attributable the jamming is — sophisticated deceptive jamming buys effectiveness and stealth at the
cost of needing prior signal intercept and certain attribution once caught.

## 5. Implementation Guidance

- **A new jamming feature must derive success from physical inputs through `jam.effective_success_prob`**,
  never accept an operator-typed probability — this was an explicit, audited fix (Jun 2026 §C2);
  reintroducing operator-set probabilities is a regression of that fix.
- **A new modulation type must be added to the `MODULATIONS` database** with all five parameters
  (`effectiveness`, `radius_factor`, `attribution_bias`, `detectability`, `power_factor`) — don't
  special-case a new modulation in the resolver instead.
- **EW effects remain window-gated through `JAM_FOOTPRINT`** — do not give a new EW capability a
  cyber-style "resolves anywhere, anytime" path; that exception is reserved for cyber ([R116](R116-cyber-operations-against-space-systems.md)) by
  explicit doctrine.
- **Defensive mitigation should modify the resolver's outcome, not the jam-math module** — keep
  `jam.py` a pure, defender-agnostic computation of the attack's raw potency.

## 6. Feature Mapping

FS-105 (Spacecraft Operations) is the direct consumer — any EW-adjacent UI should expose the
modulation tradeoff (effectiveness vs. detectability vs. attribution) explicitly, not collapse it to
a single "jam" button.
